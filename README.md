# LightGbmDotNet

A .NET wrapper for the [LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM) machine learning library, including GPU support.


LightGBM is one of the leading Gradient Boosting solutions, provided open source by Microsoft.


### Usage (C#):

```C#
using(var lightGbm = new LightGbm())
{
   lightGbm.Train(trainingData); //optionally pass parameters
   var predictions = lightGbm.Predict(predictionData); //returns an array of predictions
   lightGbm.SaveModel("somefile.txt"); //for later reuse of the trained machine learning model without retraining
}
```

Where both `trainingData` and `predictionData` are of type `IEnumerable<IEnumerable<double>>` representing rows of double values.

First column in `trainingData` is the label column (the value that you want to predict). 
Omit this column in `predictionData`.
